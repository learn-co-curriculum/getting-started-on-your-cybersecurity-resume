# Building Your Resume

Your resume is the main way of catching the attention of a recruiter or hiring manager. It is the vehicle that you use to tell your story and to outline your strengths that enable you to contribute to the success of the company. A resume highlights your skills, achievements and experience. Think of it as your proxy, as well as a critical component in crafting your personal brand. What do you want this piece of paper to say about you when you can’t be there to say it yourself?

By keeping your resume concise, it gives a preview of what you can do without giving your full story away. You want to highlight just enough to entice your potential employer to call you for more information.

## Getting Started on Your New Cybersecurity Resume

As with most technical careers, cybersecurity resumes are crucial for deciphering (at first glance) whether you have the skills for the job. Beyond your technical experience and projects, your other experience (non-technical) also tells an important story about why you are applying for this position.  There should be a well-balanced mix of your technical and soft skills throughout your resume. 


**Resume Template**

## Key Things to Keep in Mind

**Email addresses:** should be @gmail.com @me.com or @customdomain; no AOL, Hotmail or Yahoo email accounts because employers may view users with those accounts as out-of-touch or not tech savvy.

Providing your full address is no longer necessary in a resume. Recruiters still expect to see city, state and zip-code, especially if they are taking into account commute time when considering a candidate. If you’re planning to relocate there are two ways to address this in your resume.  They are as follows: 

  - Include the cities or states you’re willing to relocate to, or merely write “willing  to relocate”
  
  - If you have a place secured and are absolutely certain about moving, you can include your new City/State/Zip.

Especially if, for example, you’re living in Chicago and thinking of relocating to San Diego, it’s best not to tip off a recruiter that you aren’t local by including your Chicago address. Your phone number and email are the primary ways employers are going to contact you.
